**MOST IMPORTANT**
You must;
pip install colorama
pip install rar
pip install tqdm


If you're reading this, you might know what these tools are used for already but in case you don't;
These tools are used to partition and encrypt files, as well as later decrypt them.
I wrote this code when I was a little drunk, but here is an example of how this would be used in a real case.
> 100GB file named crazyman.rar in c:\when
> user partitions crazyman.rar into parts of 500mb each into c:\now
> user uploads each 500mb file **AND THE PASSWORDS.txt FILE** onto multiup for easy downloads
> user provides info on how to decrypt the file and extract it for use
> customer downloads every 500mb file, **AND PASSWORDS.txt**
> customer runs extractor tool, oh wow, i have the extract contents of crazyman.rar

**I AM NOT LIABLE IF THIS TOOL IS USED MALICIOUSLY AT ALL. THIS WAS USED TO ENCRYPT AND COMPRESS CODE.**

***This is currently on version 1.0. It is buggy as hell, missing a GUI, and currently only will work if you partition a .rar file.***

*upcoming updates;*
  Support for .zip, .7z, etc. partition encrypting and decrypting
  Allow encrypter to partition folders (This will remove the need to turn a folder into a .rar before partitioning it, the program will do it for you.)
  Better Error Logging
  Sleek and Easy GUI
